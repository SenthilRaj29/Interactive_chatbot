# Interactive_chatbot
A simple interactive chatbot built using Python. 
This project was created as part of the CodeAlpha Internship to demonstrate basic input-output interaction using conditional logic and string processing in Python
This is a fun and relatable Python-based chatbot created as part of my CodeAlpha Internship.  
The bot responds to common student-life questions — especially those from an engineering perspective. From viva trauma to WiFi rage, this chatbot gets you. 😄

## 🚀 What It Does

- Simulates a real-time chat conversation
- Accepts user input and responds with witty, hard-hitting college humor
- Matches close input using `difflib` for flexibility
- Built entirely in **Python** with zero external packages

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Entertainment chatbot for students (especially engineers)
- Great beginner-level project to understand:
  - Dictionaries for response mapping
  - String similarity with `difflib.get_close_matches()`
  - Infinite loops, input/output
- Can be extended to support more topics, jokes, or even a GUI

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Standard Library only (`difflib` for fuzzy matching)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

---

## 🔧 How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.  
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the chatbot file location, and run:

```bash
python chatbot.py
